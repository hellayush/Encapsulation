Q1 - What is encapulation in Java ? Why it is called Data hiding ?

ANS - Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It helps in controlling the access to the data by hiding the internal state of an object and only allowing access through well-defined methods.

Data Hiding: It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes a limited interface through which the object's data can be accessed and modified. This prevents direct manipulation of the object's data from outside the class, which helps in maintaining data integrity and prevents accidental misuse.

Q2 - What are important features of Encapsulation ?

ANS - Features of encapsulation are : 

 * Data Hiding: Internal state of objects is hidden from external access.

 * Access Control: Control over access to class members using access modifiers like public, private, etc.

 * Abstraction: Separates interface from implementation, hiding complexity.

 * Data Integrity: Ensures consistency and validity of data by enforcing constraints.

 * Modularity: Groups related data and behavior together, promoting code organization.

 * Flexibility and Evolution: Enables classes to evolve independently without impacting external code.

Q3 - What are Getter and Setter in java  ? Explain with an example .

ANS - In Java, getters and setters are methods used to access and modify the values of private instance variables (fields) of a class, respectively. Here's a brief explanation:

Getter:

  * Getter methods are used to retrieve the value of a private instance variable.
  * They typically have a get prefix followed by the name of the variable being accessed.
  * Getters are commonly used to provide read-only access to private fields.


Setter:

   * Setter methods are used to modify the value of a private instance variable.
   * They typically have a set prefix followed by the name of the variable being modified, and they take a parameter representing the new value.
   * Setters are commonly used to provide write-only access to private fields or to enforce validation rules before setting the value.

Q4 - What is the use of this keyword explain with example .

ANS - 
In Java, the this keyword is used to refer to the current instance of a class. Its main uses are:

  * Reference to Current Object: this is used to reference the current object within an instance method or constructor.

  * Disambiguation: It's used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters or local variables with the same name.

  * Constructor Chaining: this is used to call one constructor from another constructor within the same class, enabling constructor chaining.

  * Passing the Current Object: this can be passed as an argument to other methods or constructors to provide a reference to the current object.

  * Returning the Current Object: It can be returned from methods, allowing method chaining where multiple methods can be called on the same object in a single statement.

Q5 - Wht are the advantages of encapsulation ?

ANS -  Advantages of encapsulation are : 

	* We can achieve security.
	* Enhancement becomes easy .
	* Maintainability and modularisation becomes easy.
	* It provides flexibility to the user to use the system very easily.

Q6 - How to achieve encapsulation in java ? Give an example .

ANS -   Encapsulation in Java is achieved by:

Declaring the instance variables of a class as private to restrict direct access from outside the class.
Providing public methods, also known as getter and setter methods, to access and modify the values of the private instance variables.
